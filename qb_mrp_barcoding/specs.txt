Manage MO Workorders with Barcode Scanner

Goal:  Scan a manufacturing order and the next workorder to be done in the sequence pops up and is managed by the barcode scanner.

Workflows and Details:
 1. If there are no workorders or all workorders are done.
           a. The MO comes up and the "Mark as Todo, Plan, Check Availability, Scrap, Cancel" barcodes to click those buttons could be scanned to move the MO forward.
           b. If "Plan" is clicked, then the next screen will be the first workorder in the sequence.
                      
2. Once a Workorder is opened
           a. "Process" button is scanned 
                     i. Barcoded lots are then scanned for the assignment of lots and quantities to consume for them*.
           b. If there is an item consumed in this WO then, if a lot number is scanned, it will be assigned to the consumed stock move*.
           c. If a lot number for the finished good is scanned, it will be assigned to the finished item*.
           d. "Validate, Continue Consumption, Mark as Done, Mark as Done and Close MO" buttons are scannable to move the WO and MO forward.        

3. All workorders are done
             a. Barcode scan "Mark as Done, Check Availability, Post Inventory, Scrap, Cancel" buttons
               i. If the "Mark as Done" or "Post Inventory" button is clicked, then the inventory is posted and the MO is done.
